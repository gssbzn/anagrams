Anagrams
========
An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example Doctor Who can be rearranged into Torchwood. Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram.

An ananagram is a word or phrase that has no anagrams, this is, no other word or phrase can be generated as a result of rearranging the letters of it, using all the original letters exactly once; for example Sun can not be rearranged into another word.

Given a list of words determine wich words are anagrams (or have no anagrams).
